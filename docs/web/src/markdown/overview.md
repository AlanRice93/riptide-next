# Most frameworks focus on plumbing

They ship with tools to define a REST API for your frontends, an ORM to transform objects into something your database understands, and if you're lucky, a pub/sub system for some light realtime functionality.

As your application evolves, your time becomes increasingly devoted to juggling these disparate systems and building the pipes that hold it all together.

Riptide eases this burden by taking the plumbing - how data is moved around, transformed, and saved - and making it invisible.  You're responsible purely for the logic of your application which you can implement scalably using Riptide's tooling as simple cause and effect rules.

Most frameworks rely on you to maintain the pipes.  Riptide keeps the flow going so you can focus on your product.

## The same data model â€” everywhere

Traditional frameworks require you to think about your data differently depending on where it is.  Objects in your frontend and backend applications, relational tables in your database, events in your message queue.

Riptide enforces a singular data model - a tree - no matter where you are.

# Beyond REST, ORMs and Pub/Sub

Most application frameworks ship with tools to define a REST API for your frontends, an ORM to transform incoming data into something your database understands, and if you're lucky, a pub/sub system to keep everything in sync.  

This approach your energy is spent juggling these disparate systems and building the glue that holds them together. Nevermind the tools you're missing to manage your increasingly complex business logic.  

Riptide eases this pain by taking a functional approach. -->
