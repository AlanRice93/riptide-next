# Most frameworks get it wrong

They ship with tools to define a REST API for your frontends, an ORM to transform incoming data into something your database understands, and if you're lucky, a pub/sub system to keep everything in sync.

It's up to you to juggle these disparate systems and as your application evolves, more of your energy becomes devoted to managing the glue that holds it all together.

Riptide eases this pain by taking a functional approach.
